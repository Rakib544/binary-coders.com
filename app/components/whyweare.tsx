        Our first and foremost objective is to introduce students to the fundamentals of
        programming. Despite studying in the computer department, many of us do not really know what
        programming is! The victims of this are those of us who are trying to build a community. We
        have noticed that many of the students of 5th, 6th, 7th even after completing their diploma
        know what programming actually is? So our purpose is to give everyone a basic idea about
        programming. It is not our intention to teach programming from the beginning to the end, we
        want to teach everyone the basics of programming, so that from then on he can finish the
        rest by himself.
